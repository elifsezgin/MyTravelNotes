# MyTravelNotes

MyTravelNotes is a full-stack mobile application that provides a notebook for travelers where they can create notes to save their memories, pin it on map and never lose it again. It allows users to share their experiences with others travelers or keep their memories to themselves.  It utilizes Python on Django on the back end, a PostgreSQL database with a React-native architectural framework on the front end.
